A custom asset mod for Hollow Knight: Silksong with particular attention to ease of creation.

## What does it do?

### Sprite Replacement
Patchwork lets you customize practically all sprites in the game - and without the hassle of dealing with spritesheets. It automatically splits up each sprite into an individual, named file, for the convenience of both artists and users. Here's some key features:

* Individual sprite image files - properly rotated, sized and named, no need for external programs
* Full compatibility with spritesheet-based skins
* Auto-reload on file change, so you can see your sprites ingame immediately
* Built-in sprite dumping functionality

### Audio Replacement
Replacement of audio files is planned, but not currently supported.

* To [RatherChaoticDev](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/RatherChaoticDev) who created the original [Silksong Customizer](https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/142) mod that Patchwork was based on
* To [Su4enka](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Su4enka) whose CustomizerT2D plugin (as part of their [Cute Hornet skin](https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/203)) helped with adding T2D support to Patchwork
